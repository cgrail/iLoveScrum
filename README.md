iLoveScrum
===========

This app helps you estimating your User Stories and Features with the help of the heartbeat of your developers.

In the Scrum Estimation meeting the developers need put on pulse sensors which measure their heartbeat in realtime. This heartbeat is then used to give a realtime rough estimate about the User Stories and the Features the Product Owner presents to the team.

Ideas for the future
====================
- Use photos taken shortly after the developers have seen a User Story for the first time and recognize the emotion of the developer.
